# x86 Assembly Project Template

This is a template for creating x86 assembly projects using the MASM assembler. It is configured for use with Visual Studio Code and supports building, executing, and debugging your assembly code with ease.

## Features

- **Build Shortcut**: Quickly build your project using the build shortcut.
- **Debugging**: Full debugging support using MSVC. Set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect registers.
- **Execute with F5**: Run your project directly from VS Code using the F5 key.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Enhanced syntax highlighting with the "ASM Code Lens" extension.

## Requirements

1. **Install Visual Studio 2022 and MASM**:
   - **Download and Install Visual Studio 2022**:
     - Go to the [Visual Studio 2022 download page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
     - Download the installer and follow the installation instructions.
   - **Install MASM**:
     - During the Visual Studio installation, select the "Desktop development with C++" workload.
     - Ensure the "MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools" component is selected.
   - **Set Up Environment Variables**:
     - After installation, add the MASM directory to your environment variables. Typically, the directory is located somewhere like:
       ```
       C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.29.30133\bin\Hostx86\x86
       ```
     - In the path above, "2022" is the year of Visual Studio and "14.29.30133" would be the current version of the IDE. They may be slightly different for you as it depends on your current install.
     - IMPORTANT: You should add both the x86 "Hostx86\x86" and x64 "Hostx64\x64" folders to your Environment variables to prevent issues.

2. **Visual Studio Code**:
   - Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This is what you will be writing your actual code in.

3. **Change VS Code Settings**:
    Go to `File` > `Preferences` > `Settings`.
    Search for `debug.AllowBreakpointsEverywhere` and set it to `true`. This allows you to place breakpoints in your assembly code.

4. **ASM Code Lens Extension**:
   - For unparalleled syntax highlighting, download and install the [ASM Code Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maziac.asm-code-lens) extension from the VS Code Marketplace.

## Getting Started

1. **Install the Necessary Requirements**:
    Follow the steps in the "Requirements" section above to download and install all the necessary tools.

2. **Clone or Download the Template**:
    Click the green "Use this Template" button on the top right of this page. Alternatively, you can clone the repository or download the template as a ZIP file and extract it to your desired project location.

3. **Open in Visual Studio Code**:
    Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

4. **Build the Project**:
    Use the build shortcut (default `Ctrl+Shift+B`) to assemble and link your project.

5. **Debug and Run the Project**:
    Press F5 to start debugging. You can set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect registers.


## Configuration Files

- **launch.json**: Configuration for debugging with MSVC.
- **tasks.json**: Tasks for assembling and linking the project using MASM.

## Example Code

Hereâ€™s a sample of what your `main.asm` will look like:

```assembly
; Program Configuration
.386
.model flat, stdcall
.stack 4096

; Data segment
.data

; Code segment
.code                   
main PROC
    nop ; Code start

    nop ; Code end
    ret
main ENDP
END main
```

Troubleshooting

   - Environment Variables: Ensure that the MASM directory is correctly added to your environment variables.
   - Dependencies: Make sure all dependencies are correctly installed and their paths are correctly set.
   - Breakpoints: Ensure debug.AllowBreakpointsEverywhere is set to true in your VS Code settings to place breakpoints in the editor.

By following these steps and using this template, you can efficiently create and manage your x86 assembly projects in Visual Studio Code.

Happy coding!
